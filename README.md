# React Practice Compilation

This is a compilation of small projects/components built for practice. The content consists of React projects using hooks, redux, or simply just React(both functional and class components). 

Semantic UI is used for basic styling. Some components may not be mobile responsive. This is not a final product as I will be adding more projects as I build them.
